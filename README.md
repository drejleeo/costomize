# costomize

> [!NOTE]
> `costomize` stands for OS customization and it's a tool for quick initialization of new OS with the configured preferences.
Simple for now but, overtime, it will get quite complex.

## Ambition
 - Save time on each new OS customization, installing your preferred tools via `bash`.
 - Keep it modular, allowing feature toggling.
 - Make it cross-platform to work on linux systems as well.
