# costomize

> [!NOTE]
> `costomize` stands for OS customization and it's a tool for quick initialization of new OS with the configured preferences.
Simple for now but, overtime, it will get quite complex.


## Ambition
 - Save time on each new OS customization, installing your preferred tools via `bash`.
